COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

This looks pretty good, Patrick. You had more than your share of
challenges, getting git up and connected to GitHub on your laptop--
thanks for your patience and diligence in working through all of 
that. 

Hopefully you have a little bit of an idea on how git works now.
Enough that you'll run screaming from the room the next time somebody
mentions `git`. 

SCORE: 20/20
